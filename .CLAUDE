<purpose>
This is a botique ecommerce shop for an indigenous artist selling handcrafted beaded lighter cases.
Maintain a professional, high-quality aesthetic throughout the site.
</purpose>

<development>
This site uses `bun` for it's runtime, use `bun dev` and `bun run build` when needed.
</development>

<design-system>
- Primary color palette uses warm earth tones inspired by Native American beadwork
- Key background color: `rgb(var(--product-bg))` = rgb(254, 251, 246) = #FEFBF6
- Always use CSS variables for colors to maintain consistency
- Use `bg-product-bg` class for product-related backgrounds
- Product images have edge feathering (inset box-shadow) to blend with background
- Header is solid/opaque; size filter uses glassmorphism (blur + transparency)
- Animations use framer-motion for React components, CSS transitions for simpler effects
</design-system>

<component-patterns>
Header + ShippingBanner:
- Uses HeaderStateProvider context (use-header-state.tsx) for shared scroll state
- Banner + nav exit together when scrolling down
- Only nav returns when scrolling up mid-page
- Banner only returns at scrollY === 0 with fade-in effect
- Banner is display:none when hidden to prevent blur sampling its orange color

ProductCard:
- Uses skeleton overlay pattern: skeleton renders behind, content fades in over it
- Image flip/swap uses XOR logic: `isHovering !== isFlipped` for toggle behavior
- Desktop: flip button (RotateCcw icon) in top-left corner
- Mobile: ghost chevrons on edges + pagination dots at bottom center
- Swipe gestures work via useTouchSwipe hook
- Uses `.image-loaded` class added via onLoad for staggered image fade-in

ProductGrid:
- Handles infinite scroll with intersection observer via `setupObserver` ref
- Category/size filtering done server-side via API parameters
- SizeFilter is sticky with backdrop blur for premium "ghost" effect
- Uses `header-visible` class to push filter down when header is shown

SizeFilter:
- Uses 80% opacity background with 12px blur for see-through effect
- Dynamically positioned based on header visibility (top: 0 or 64px/80px)
- Transitions smoothly with header show/hide
</component-patterns>

<workflow>
Git Worktree Workflow for Multiple Agents:
- When working on a feature, create a worktree: `git worktree add .worktrees/<feature-name> -b <feature-branch-name>`
- Work within your worktree directory: `cd .worktrees/<feature-name>`
- Commit changes regularly to include them in the feature branch
- Push changes periodically to remote: `git push -u origin <feature-branch-name>`
- When feature is complete, return to main directory and use the `/merge-worktree` skill to integrate changes
- The merge-worktree skill will:
  - Verify all changes are committed
  - Merge the feature branch into main
  - Delete the worktree and feature branch after successful merge
- This allows multiple agents to work independently without conflicts
</workflow>

<potential-improvements>
- Consider consolidating animation logic into custom hooks
- ProductCard's hover/flip state could be simplified with a reducer
- The skeleton-shimmer CSS could use the product-bg variable instead of hardcoded values
- Consider extracting image loading logic into a reusable hook with skeleton state
- Touch/swipe handlers could be unified with the hover/flip logic
